Description:
This is a very straight forward Countdown Timer application where you as the chef can create as many timers necessary to assist with keeping track of your ingredients/items while they are in the process of cooking. A form is present for you to fill out the item name, minutes, and seconds. Timers will run simultaneously with each other for better tracking and once the countdown has decremented entirely, the timer will disappear. 

Testing the Timer App:
- There are 3 input fields: Item Name, Minutes, and Seconds. Please fill them all out accurately.
- Once you are done filling out the fields, hit the "Start Timer" button to initiate your timer.
- The Timer will disappear once the countdown has finished.
- Once a countdown timer has finished, you will notice that the name is still present. This indicates that this previous timer has finished and you no longer have to time it again. :)
- To add an additional timer, simply hit the "Reset Timer" button as it will clear the input fields for you to fill out again with your new inputs. Hit "Start Timer" again and see your new timer in action working simultaneously with the others.
