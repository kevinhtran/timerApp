// input form where you can enter the name of your timer and once you hit the enter button, it sets the name.
// the placeholder name of the input form will say "ingredient name"
// while the timer is running,

// jsx component within this button wrapper

// where do timers appear on the page?
// do they just appear side to side? stack on each other?
// if side-to-side, should it be in a grid container where 3 timers take up one roll (12 cols on the row)

// use milliseconds for everything
// have a helper function that helps you break diown the milliseconds to seconds, minutes, hours
